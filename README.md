In this Amazon themed NODE.js application, you can log in as either a customer or the manager.  

If logged in as a customer, you are able to see a list of all products for sale, including their departments, cost, and the amount of inventory available.  These items are stored in a HeidiSQL database.  You can then choose items to purchase and receive a total cost of your order.  It also will alert you if the inventory is too low to fulfill your order, and will automatically update the inventory to reflect your purchase.

If logged in as the manager, you can view all of the available items, view only items with low inventory (less than five units), add inventory to any current product, or add a new product.  Any choices will instantly update the HeidiSQL database to reflect what you have done.
